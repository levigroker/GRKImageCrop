GRKImageCrop
===========
A UIImage category which provides "visible" pixel cropping capabilities.

A given image can be rectangularly cropped based on calculated insets to "visible" pixels.
Visible pixels are those whose alpha component are greater than or equal to a given alpha
threshold.

### Installing

If you're using [CocoPods](http://cocopods.org) it's as simple as adding this to your
`Podfile`:

	pod 'GRKImageCrop'

otherwise, simply add the contents of the `GRKImageCrop` subdirectory to your
project.

### Documentation

To use, simply import `UIImage+GRKImageCrop.h`:

    #import "UIImage+GRKImageCrop.h"
    
Then you can use the category to create a cropped image from a given image:

	[image cropImageBelowAlphaThreshold:0.0f completion:^(UIImage *croppedImage, NSError *error) {
		if (croppedImage)
		{
			//Use croppedImage
		}
		else
		{
			//Hanlde error
		}
	}];

The only expected error would be memory related.

Additional documentation is available in `UIImage+GRKImageCrop.h` and example usage
can be found in the `GRKImageCropTestApp`.
